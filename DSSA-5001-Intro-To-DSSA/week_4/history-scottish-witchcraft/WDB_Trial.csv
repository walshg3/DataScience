The Lord Chief Justice agreed.  They specified that since her first trial (ending in acquittal and release) many confessed witches had denounced her.  The bailies and ministers requested and received a new order for arrest.  The bailie David Chrystie refused to arrest her because the warrant did not specify the breaking down of doors.  The ministers sought a new commission for breaking down doors.  They appointed Alexander Colville, justice depute, as prosecutor.
